# NDB
A name database for the IRE game, Starmourn. It could also be used for other IREs with a little bit of tweaking. It's designed exactly with that in mind. 

## Installation
Clone/download this repository as zip, then through your mudlet, install the .mpackage file and reload your mudlet profile. Your name database should be up and running in no time.

## Usage
NQW             - Will add all currently online players to the database with their relevant details, and should start highlighting the names of said players, according to their faction.
QW              - Will start highlighting ALL currently online players that are ALREADY added in the database.
HONOURS <name>  - Will add a specific player to the database, along with their relevant details.
WHOIS <name>    - Will search your database for a specific player and show you all relevant details about that player.

## Future plans
- A way to track friends and enemies and highlight them separate from their names respective faction.
- A usable API for other coders to use in their respective systems.
- Refining database access and use and improve performance.
- A way for users to set individual configurations for the functionality of NDB. such as setting different highlighting colors other than the default.
